      <p>
        Tom Haines began Aikido training at Arizona Aikikai in the early 1970s. He earned his first
        black belt from Jon Takagi Sensei and continued to train through several major shifts in
        Aikido organizations.

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-slate-50">Teachers and ranks</h2>
      <p>
        Over the years he trained with instructors such as Jon Takagi, Fumio Toyoda, TK Chiba, and
        Mitsugi Saotome, receiving dan rankings through Aikido Association of America, the United
        States Aikido Federation, and Aikido Schools of Ueshiba.

        This varied background informs the way he presents Aikido, connecting Arizona Aikido’s
        history with its present affiliation.
