<BaseLayout title="Arizona Aikido – Image Galleries">
  <h1>Image Galleries</h1>

  <p>
    The image gallery on the original site is organized into several collections showing
    the dojo, its history, and its people.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Arizona Aikido History</li>
    <li>Aikido Personalities</li>
    <li>Camps and Seminars</li>
    <li>Japan Trip – June 2007</li>
    <li>Arizona Agatsu Dojo</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Later we can create separate pages or dynamic gallery views for each collection and
    wire the images to match the existing site.
  </p>
