      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-slate-50">Beginning Aikido</h2>
      <p>
        Don Crawford Sensei began his study of Aikido in January 1980 under the guidance of
        Tsuneji Sakakibara Sensei and Jon Takagi Sensei at Arizona Aikikai. From the beginning he
        trained closely with the core group of students who helped carry the dojo forward.

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-slate-50">Ranks and teachers</h2>
      <p>
        He received his shodan in February 1987 through T.K. Chiba shihan, his nidan in January
        1992 and sandan in January 1995 with Hiroshi Ikeda shihan, and his yondan in December 2001
        and godan in January 2010 with Mitsugi Saotome shihan.
      </p>
      <p>
        These connections to several major teachers in the Aikido world helped keep Arizona Aikido
        closely tied to the broader Aikido community while maintaining its own identity.

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-slate-50">Leadership at Arizona Aikido</h2>
      <p>
        After the death of Takagi Sensei, Crawford Sensei took on an important leadership role in
        Arizona Aikido, helping with both training and organizational stability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years he has served as president of the corporation and currently serves as
        treasurer, handling responsibilities that allow the dojo to operate as a nonprofit
        community organization.

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-slate-50">Ongoing contribution</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to his administrative work, he continues to train and teach, support seminars,
        and mentor students. His combination of long-term practice and steady behind-the-scenes
        effort is a key part of Arizona Aikido’s continuity.
